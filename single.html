			<h1>Genghis Khan: First Great Khan of Mongol Empire</h1>
			<p>After starting from obscure and insignificant beginnings, Chinggis Khan (birthname <b>Temujin</b> — he didn't acquire the title "Chinggis Khan" until 1206) brought all the nomadic tribes of Mongolia under the rule of himself and his family in a rigidly disciplined military state.
<br></p>
			<img class="genghis" src="images/portrait.gif">
			<p class="right-side">After establishing this unity, Chinggis turned his attention toward the settled peoples beyond the borders of his nomadic realm and began the series of campaigns of plunder and conquest that eventually led to the establishment of the great Mongol Empire. 
			<br>
			<br>
			No contemporaneous portrait of Chinggis Khan has survived to this day. The painting shown here is a much later imagining of what the warrior/ruler might have looked like.

			<h2>
				Genghis Khan and the promotion of the Silk Road
			</h2>
			<img src="images/silk.jpg">
			<p>
				Even before the rise of Genghis Khan, towns scattered along the Silk Road in Mongolia were actively involved in the trade that took place along its route, and this is supported by both archaeological evidence and written sources.
<br><br>
When Genghis Khan eventually rose to power and began his conquests, control of the Silk Road trade – and dealing with certain trade disputes – were an essential part of the development. One of the sources where this becomes apparent is the chronicle of Mongol history written by <i>‘Ata-Malik Juvaini</i> – himself not a Mongol – in the 1250s.
<br><br>
The flourishing of the Silk Road under Mongolian rule was due to several factors, including Mongolian promotion of the route and the improvement of vital infrastructure that helped make the trips safer.

			<h2>The four most significant legacies of Chinggis Khan</h2>
			<p><b>
• his tolerance of many religions<br>
• his creation of the Mongols' first script<br>
• his support for trade and crafts<br>
• his creation of a legal code specific to the Mongols' pastoral-nomadic way of life</b>
